# Forkify 

The Forkify Recipe application allows user to search for various different recipes using the [Forkify API](https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/v2) and deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Users can view the recipe along with the cook time and also update the amount of servings they need for different number of people.
Also as a user we can save the recipe and create our own recipe so that we can have them organized in the same app.
Favorite meals are stored in local storage so no database was required for this application.
