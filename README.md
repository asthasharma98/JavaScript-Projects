# JavaScript-Projects

This repository contains some different small projects purely based on `JS`, `HTML`, `CSS`. As being a complete fresher in the development world, The main purpose of these projects were to learn and apply some fundamentals to advance JavaScript concepts. These projects are from the Udemy online course [The Complete JavaScript Course 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/) and this is by far the best comprehensive development related content I have ever taken.
